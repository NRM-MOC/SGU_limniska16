# SGU_limniska16

This repo contains the code and data used to format data from the 2016 limnic programme to SGU-friendly format. Since standardised lab-protocols were not available, data is drawn from a subset of the limnic prc-file. Analysis-specific parameters are copied from the lab-protocols of the 2018-programme and joined, see the lab_details.csv-file.
